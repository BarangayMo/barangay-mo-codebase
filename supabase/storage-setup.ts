// This file serves as documentation for the storage setup required
// To create the storage bucket manually in Supabase:
// 1. Go to Storage in the Supabase dashboard
// 2. Create a new bucket named "user_uploads" 
// 3. Configure the bucket with the following settings:
//    - Public access: Enabled
//    - Allow file downloads without authentication: Enabled

// The following Row Level Security (RLS) policies should be applied:
// - Allow anyone to read from this bucket (for public access to media)
// - Allow authenticated users to upload to this bucket
// - Allow users to update their own files
// - Allow users to delete their own files

// Storage policies should look like:
/*
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT
  USING (bucket_id = 'user_uploads');

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to upload files" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'user_uploads' AND auth.uid() = owner);

CREATE POLICY "Allow users to update their own files" ON storage.objects
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (bucket_id = 'user_uploads' AND auth.uid() = owner);

CREATE POLICY "Allow users to delete their own files" ON storage.objects
  FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (bucket_id = 'user_uploads' AND auth.uid() = owner);
